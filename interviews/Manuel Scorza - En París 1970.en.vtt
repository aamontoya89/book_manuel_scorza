00:00:00.759 --> 00:00:05.149
I: Manuel Scorza, how did
you become a writer?

00:00:05.306 --> 00:00:08.568
how was your novel
"Redoble por Rancas" born?

00:00:08.640 --> 00:00:16.195
M: "Redoble por Rancas", like all the 
novels I have written, is a book,

00:00:16.632 --> 00:00:22.994
in fact it applies to al my books,
which I experienced before writing.

00:00:24.405 --> 00:00:28.833
In reality, "Redoble Por Rancas" is a 
book that was born in reality before

00:00:29.143 --> 00:00:35.064
than in literature. And I say this because
even though I have studies in literature

00:00:35.294 --> 00:00:40.553
and I had already written five poems, when
I participated in the peasant war,

00:00:41.145 --> 00:00:45.592
in what is now know as the 1960 peasant
war, which in those times

00:00:45.815 --> 00:00:51.666
were events almost unknown in Perú,
I didn't go with a literary intention.

00:00:52.084 --> 00:00:59.236
I did participate on the indigenous'
side on the last of the great

00:00:59.573 --> 00:01:08.663
quechua rebellions of 1960 when
the commmunities from the center rebelled

00:01:08.744 --> 00:01:14.828
against latifundium and against abuses
from a North American mining company

00:01:14.874 --> 00:01:20.830
called Cerro de Pasco Corporation.
In year 1960 as I was saying,

00:01:20.947 --> 00:01:25.579
the last of these last indigenous
rebellions happened, which are not

00:01:25.625 --> 00:01:30.362
included in history, and constitute many
chapters of what I call the invisible war.

00:01:30.443 --> 00:01:34.774
A war that doesn't show up on history
books, but which has produced

00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:41.264
millions of deaths. To give you an idea
of what this genocide is and this

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:45.745
combat, I must give you the well known
number that when the Conquista started

00:01:45.792 --> 00:01:52.212
in Perú there were approximately fifteen
million people, and by the end of the

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:56.512
Conquista fifty years later, population
had decresead to one million people.

00:01:56.602 --> 00:02:00.793
I: What are your activities here in France, in Paris?

00:02:00.912 --> 00:02:06.323
M: In France, I am fundamentally a 
Latin American literature professor at

00:02:06.485 --> 00:02:11.292
the École normale de Saint-Cloud, and also
I occasionally work as translator.

00:02:11.466 --> 00:02:14.902
You know how we live in Paris,
doing a bit of everything.

00:02:15.274 --> 00:02:17.433
I: What is Paris for you?

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:25.832
M: Paris for me has not been a feast
at all. You remember the Hemingway

00:02:25.877 --> 00:02:29.774
book "A moveable feast". I think
that for us Latin American people

00:02:29.814 --> 00:02:36.172
it is rarely a feast. If you allow me,
I would make the question a bit broader,

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:39.899
because generally we ask
"Why are you in Paris?"

00:02:40.061 --> 00:02:44.903
I think that we Latin American artists,
we come to Paris

00:02:45.065 --> 00:02:48.084
fundamentally for cultural reasons.

00:02:48.211 --> 00:02:51.242
Because Paris is a very important
cultural center.

00:02:51.497 --> 00:02:56.605
There has always been a migration of
artists to the big cultural centers.

00:02:56.687 --> 00:02:59.879
There was one in Rome, there was one
during renaissance to Florence

00:02:59.972 --> 00:03:04.140
and the Italian cities, and there is one
now to Paris and New York.

00:03:04.605 --> 00:03:10.793
I: Manuel, do you think that this city
so called "the city of light",

00:03:10.921 --> 00:03:13.962
is it easy for an anonymous
Latin American person?

00:03:14.137 --> 00:03:17.921
M: Life in Paris is very hard
for all people.

00:03:18.003 --> 00:03:23.297
It is in Paris where we remember
that verse from Quevedo,

00:03:23.424 --> 00:03:25.932
a beautiful and big verse,
"the civil war of the newborns"

00:03:26.095 --> 00:03:29.856
Here in Paris even in order to be on your
two feet you have to fight to death.

00:03:30.007 --> 00:03:34.175
In that sense, Paris is a very hard city,
but it is a fundamental city

00:03:34.349 --> 00:03:38.262
because it allows us to communicate
with the world. It is a vehicle city.

00:03:38.471 --> 00:03:40.561
I: Of contact.
M: Of contact.

00:03:40.700 --> 00:03:44.473
Also don't you forget that we are not
far away from our countries.

00:03:44.636 --> 00:03:48.641
In our countries there are people
who are even more far away

00:03:48.804 --> 00:03:52.438
even though they are living there.

00:03:52.519 --> 00:03:55.526
I: So, what do you think, this city,

00:03:55.631 --> 00:03:58.429
how is it presented to a 
notorious Latin American,

00:03:58.521 --> 00:04:00.472
is it the same for them?

00:04:00.553 --> 00:04:09.168
M: To a notorious Latin American person,
I think that they are given the chance to

00:04:09.249 --> 00:04:14.299
contact the great French intelligence,
meet the greatest Europeans.

00:04:14.427 --> 00:04:20.058
Because we can talk a lot about
the hardships of Paris,

00:04:20.139 --> 00:04:24.284
but evidently here there is
a first-class intelligence,

00:04:24.388 --> 00:04:28.858
and this intelligence allows us to make
the exact questioning of our

00:04:28.986 --> 00:04:32.272
problem, which is the most serious,
the third world one.

00:04:32.411 --> 00:04:36.115
Here we realize in a painful way
our condition of being

00:04:36.196 --> 00:04:39.574
humans of the third world, 
and here either we adopt it

00:04:39.702 --> 00:04:44.567
or we stop having it,
we quit our condition.

00:04:44.660 --> 00:04:49.199
I: Manuel, currently the critiques
in Europe and France applaud you.

00:04:49.315 --> 00:04:54.900
What is the reason for this impact
you are having in this society?

00:04:55.108 --> 00:05:00.217
M: I think that the fundamental impact
that my book could have made in France,

00:05:00.345 --> 00:05:06.684
which I acknowledge has been big,
is the current interest that

00:05:06.811 --> 00:05:12.825
European culture is having in
contemplating what we call

00:05:12.907 --> 00:05:14.985
the vision of the defeated.

00:05:15.101 --> 00:05:20.314
When Europe was a culture, the white
culture that was confident in its ways,

00:05:20.395 --> 00:05:25.039
it expanded across the world, anihilated
and destroyed practically all the

00:05:25.167 --> 00:05:31.332
cultures in the world, without ever
worrying about if these cultures

00:05:31.413 --> 00:05:38.495
were important or valuable. But now
that Europe has lost its compass in

00:05:38.588 --> 00:05:43.162
moral and ethics, because there is a big
confusion about values as you know,

00:05:43.290 --> 00:05:47.748
there is a movement of repentance and of 
regression, and of interest for the cultures

00:05:47.829 --> 00:05:52.822
that have been murdered. We ask ourselves,
what if Maya people had the key

00:05:52.915 --> 00:05:57.361
that we have lost, what if the Incas
had insights we don't know.

00:05:57.489 --> 00:06:01.715
And this movement for repentance and
interest in the losing of the way is what

00:06:01.843 --> 00:06:05.987
motivates that nowadays Europeans
are looking in other cultures

00:06:06.103 --> 00:06:08.437
insights that they might have overlooked.

00:06:08.530 --> 00:06:12.097
I: And do you think that this society
can clearly understand

00:06:12.306 --> 00:06:15.673
your work, what you are 
explaining to me right now?

00:06:15.801 --> 00:06:20.282
M: Well, I think that fundamentally yes,
because I have seen it in the press

00:06:20.317 --> 00:06:23.858
response in France, I have seen it in the
translations, and I think also

00:06:23.974 --> 00:06:28.363
that we Latin American people are in a 
moment of creation in all

00:06:28.479 --> 00:06:33.668
our language, our race, we are 
writing an universal language.

00:06:33.796 --> 00:06:38.336
That is what is important, that our books
are not being read in Europe because

00:06:38.417 --> 00:06:42.550
they are folklore, but because they are
ultimately universal.

00:06:42.596 --> 00:06:46.358
I: Would that be the role of Latin
American artists in Europe?

00:06:46.439 --> 00:06:53.963
M: I believe so. I think that even if
we want it or not, we are doomed

00:06:54.009 --> 00:06:59.988
or we have the privilege of demonstrating
our problems. The Latin American novel

00:07:00.023 --> 00:07:04.504
is like a big plaza where all the
problems of America converge.

00:07:04.539 --> 00:07:10.525
This big plaza has a double
importance because

NOTE Paragraph

00:07:10.525 --> 00:07:14.419
in Latin America we either lack 
freedom of speech or the

00:07:14.419 --> 00:07:15.789
tools to express ourselves.

00:07:15.789 --> 00:07:19.954
The novel is then the big agora
where we present our problems.

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:24.331
I: Sure. Manuel, what would be the
obligation of the Latin American artist

00:07:24.365 --> 00:07:27.082
with where they come from?

00:07:27.210 --> 00:07:29.903
M: Our obligation is very serious because

00:07:29.938 --> 00:07:36.463
it is our duty to express
our reasons, for which

00:07:36.544 --> 00:07:39.969
we have fundamentally been
an alienated culture.

00:07:40.062 --> 00:07:44.369
We have been imposed a mithology
that doesn't belong to us,

00:07:44.451 --> 00:07:47.214
the Greco-Roman mythology.

00:07:47.214 --> 00:07:51.619
Particularly with the people from Andes,
it is a mithology that has no value,

00:07:51.619 --> 00:07:55.509
not even as a culturan canon, because
our bodies, our proportions

00:07:55.509 --> 00:07:58.854
don't correspond to the Greco-Roman ideals
and that has led us to an

00:07:58.854 --> 00:08:01.414
inferiority complex.

00:08:01.414 --> 00:08:05.594
By voicing our problems, we will 
assume our true personality.
