    <p>Rumor at the old nostalgia</p>
<p>Manuel Scorza</p>
<p>1948</p>
<p>Published in <em>La Tribuna</em>, Sunday September 5th 1948</p>
<p>When light grows tired of beating against the day<br>
its golden corpse gets stranded on the docks,<br>
and there is silence between the absent ones<br>
and the swallows,<br>
laying slow eggs,<br>
does water go back to lightning&apos;s petals ?<br>
does crystal turn to displume in the lily?<br>
do you listen to the fall, flock after flock, land<br>
between the ruinous springs from the west,<br>
do you hear me arrive stomping on the smell coming from<br>
the submerged apples, are you listening to me...?</p>
<p>I remember the day when the firefly<br>
wore their ring from lost ships,<br>
time came down to even examine your silent things.<br>
Who remembered then dew holding<br>
the pigeons?<br>
who bunch of sickly planets?<br>
who loneliness bilged by the dead?<br>
who knife sharped in the moon?<br>
It was the month of the waves kneeling and waiting<br>
your crown.<br>
It was half since the undone plumage of the afternoon,<br>
from the tides, from the oblivion.</p>
<p>And now I am in the middle of the invaded months,<br>
between the last shells of the day!;<br>
I hear that you put on the dirty dress of a ghost,<br>
I feel that a blind sun<br>
rains you with water feathers, and I don&apos;t know you anymore.<br>
Who, then, are you who eternally drains<br>
fall with your bucket?<br>
who do you twist your beard to the horizon?</p>
<p>This is the time<br>
in which light tears off its eyelashes,<br>
the lily shivers in lightning&apos;s dusty bed,<br>
the bull travels overleaf the roar.<br>
This is the time<br>
in which to your just sifted island eyelids<br>
rain arrives bleeding out mockingbirds.<br>
Now the fog, they are looking!</p>
<p>Let&apos;s see the grass, I am not guilty<br>
of tarnishing the landscape like a glass!</p>
<p>Oh, combatant, what would you say if you saw<br>
the blaze that binds your bowels!<br>
It is no longer possible you didn&apos;t know your fingers<br>
emerge from the gulfs bringing here<br>
every day a flower of petrified light!<br>
It is no longer possible, nor I want to,<br>
that my heart leaves<br>
in the yellowish carriage of the leaves!</p>
<p>But don&apos;t weep for them.<br>
They are perpetually built by water.<br>
In the beginning, when the tear turns<br>
its throne transparent, it is edified by<br>
the wind that erases the tombs.<br>
Have they been seen in the piers<br>
where fall arrives,<br>
jasmine by jasmine from the bottom of the earth?</p>
<p>Rise up<br>
people don&apos;t want to believe me<br>
that everywhere you limit with dawn,<br>
that you are in the waterdrop where, already in ruins,<br>
waving its arms the horizon says goodbye...</p>
