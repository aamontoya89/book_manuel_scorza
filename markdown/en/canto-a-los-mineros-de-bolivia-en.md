Rumor at the old nostalgia  

Manuel Scorza  

1952  

You have to live absent from yourself,
you have to grow old in the middle of your childhood,
you have to cry on your knees in front of a corpse
in order to understand which night
populated the heart of the miners.

I didn't know
the melancholic height of the water
until one afternoon, during autumn,
I climbed El Alto, in La Paz,
and I contemplated the miners ascending to the future
through the stairs of their dazzling bullets.
How can we forget the missing
fighting, by heart, in the suburbs!

I looked at their houses
built over the thunder,
I went inside their lives like the ablaze coal,
I touched their bodies
only able to hold hate and lightning bolts,
when it was still the inclined age of their foreheads.

I went to Bolivia in the autumn of the time
I asked for Happiness.
Nobody answered.
I asked for Joy.
Nobody answered.
I asked for Love.
A bird
fell on my chest with its wings on fire.
Everything burned in the silence.
In the mountain sickness even silence is made out of snow.

I understood that tin
was
a
long
petrified
tear
over the frightened face of Bolivia.  
Humans were worth nothing!
Nobody cared if under their shirt
there was a body, a tunnel, or death!

In vain the miners digged
trying to bury their great fatigue;
during centuries their blind eyes searched in the metal,
without knowing that at that height crying was mist.
I am ashamed of not having known it!
Because in the cities the poets
cry the nostalgic absence of air,
but they don't know what living under the rain is,
mistaking hunger for thirst,
and thirst with a painted bird.

I was one of them.
I didn't know why the rivers
dried up in the dream
and certain faces in the Andes
are pure melancholic gazes.
Unitl the miners,
tired of having only one life for so many deaths,
tamed thunders,
fed on rocks,
drank the rains,
broke with their hands the cage of life.

En La Paz.  
Era otoño.  
Recordadlo.  
Era otoño.  
Velad por los muertos —recordadlos.  

La sangre derramada  
—era otoño—  
en el oído secreto de la tierra  
—en el otoño—  
y a través de su silencio  
—era otoño—  
descifra la raíz el idioma futuro de las flores—  
—en el otoño—  
y el aire siente que su cuerpo  
—era otoño—  
acaba en verde campanada.  
Recordadlo.  

Ya lo veis desde la altura.  
Aquí empieza  
la dinastía sucesora del rocío.  
A mi patria rota me voy.  
Mas antes de partir, decidme, mineros:  
¿Cuándo veré esta luz en los ojos de América?  
¿Hasta cuándo jugarán a los dados  
la túnica sangrienta de mi patria?  
Oh, hermanos, ruiseñores verdaderos del metal,  
¡prestadme vuestra muerte para edificar la vida!  

*México, April, 1952.*
